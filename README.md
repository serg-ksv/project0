# Practice with Git and Github

* create a simple hello-world app
* create a new repo on GitHub
* link the repo with app
* push your hello-world app into GitHub
* create a new branch
* print the ‘Hello mates!’ message using System.out.println
* create a PR with changes
* merge the PR
* remove branch
* checkout into a master in the Intellij idea and pull the changes
